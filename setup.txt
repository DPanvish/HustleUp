1) Install next js "npx create-next-app@latest ./"
2) Add extra properties to package.json for ensuring latest version of react is used across all the packages 
"packageManager": "npm@10.5.2",
"overrides": {
    "react": "$react",
    "react-dom": "$react-dom"
}
3) For Auth we are using Auth.js in Next.js "npm install next-auth@beta"
   -> For Auth Secret "npx auth secret"
   -> Complete the configuration by reading the docs in the Auth.js
